This project was created using React Bootstrap and the Spotify API.

In order to get started, simply download all the files in the repo. Then, create a new app after logging in using the Spotify Developer page. Next, replace the CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET fields with your own ID and SECRET. Run the command 'npm start' from your terminal, and you are good to go!
